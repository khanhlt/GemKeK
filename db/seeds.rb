This small connection with AppSir is part of what got me interested, but I was mostly fascinated with the concept of the game.

# Comment.create! user_id: 3, review_id: 6, content: "Given that they came out at basically the same time, comparisons with Two Point Hospital are unavoidable. This game provides a much more realistic take on hospital simulation, an approach I personally prefer, and it’s definitely not as light-hearted as its competitor. "
# Comment.create! user_id: 1, review_id: 7, content: "In terms of gameplay, it’s great that you can choose how much you want to micromanage things: you could (in principle) diagnose every patient yourself, or you can just leave everything to your doctors. You can place every single object in a room, or just plop down the templates provided. "
# Comment.create! user_id: 2, review_id: 8, content: "Something I like a lot better in this game than in 2PH is the ability to shape your own building the way you want it and that you have multiple floors available. As a result of the sometimes obtuse shapes of buildings in 2PH, I often find myself thinking of it more as a block-stacking puzzle than a simulation game, playing this game feels much less frustrating in that regard. "
# Comment.create! user_id: 3, review_id: 9, content: "The game does need a bit of polishing, though, as it’s missing some quality of life features. Moving rooms is a bit of a pain: you have to move every single object by hand and, in case of tables, you have to move everthing stacked on it before you can pick it up (hopefully you have some free surface elsewhere to store it temporarily).  "
# Comment.create! user_id: 1, review_id: 10, content: "Sometimes the tooltips are not clear: for example on why certain treatments cannot be performed on a patient.
